Principles in
System Design
Review

What did we explore this term?
Agile Software Development
test driven development/acceptance
synergy of pair programming
always working software
always write clean code! From the start.  Keep clean.
responding to change
A common suite of tools, language, API
Linux, C, POSIX
Hands-on System Programming
Concurrency, Synchronization, I/O


Agile Principles
Customer satisfaction by rapid delivery of useful software
Welcome changing requirements, even late in development
Working software is delivered frequently (weeks rather than months)
Close, daily cooperation between business people and developers
Projects are built around motivated individuals, who should be trusted
Face-to-face conversation is the best form of communication (co-location)
Working software is the principal measure of progress
Sustainable development, able to maintain a constant pace
Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design
Simplicity—the art of maximizing the amount of work not done—is essential
Self-organizing teams
Regular adaptation to changing circumstance

Common Tools
C - still the most popular programming language
base of other top 5
Linux (Unix)
programmer’s dream
supports needs and extends easily
POSIX
common vocabulary for OS services
foundation for most other languages

System Programming
Concurrency
fork(), exec(), wait()
pthread_create(), pthread_join()
Synchronization
pipe(), signal(), kill()
socket(), bind(), listen(), accept(), connect()
I/O
read(), write()
dup2()
file system

Final Quiz Topics
pipe(), fork(), dup2(), exec(), wait()
pthread_create(), pthread_join(), mutex_*()
socket(), bind(), listen(), accept(), connect(), shutdown()
I/O parsing input, string handling
Bash Scripts
Linux commands (find, grep, | > < ....)
gcc, make, gdb
Solve problems you know well first,...

Writing correct code…..
Know system call arguments & return val
at least all the ones we used in HW/QZ
sockets(), et. al.
pthreads_*()
fork(), pipe(), etc
Don’t worry about lines of code
Make it readable, a human must grade it
Remember quiz 5?  the easiest to grade
